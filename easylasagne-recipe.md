#Easy Lasagne
##Ingredients
###Shopping List
####Fruit & Veg section

Medium brown onion

####Cold Section

250g packet of grated parmesan

####Meat Dept

700-800g of Mince

###Supermarket Shelves

2 x packets of instant white sauce (this can be tricky to find, cheese sauce can be substituted). Any brand, but I generally use Maggi
1 x packet instant lasagne sheets. Any size, but look at the dish you're going to use
1 x Large Jar of Dolmio Pasta Sauce in Spring or Farmhouse Vegetable

##In your Pantry

  Olive oil
  Minced Garlic

##Method

Preheat your oven to 180

###Meat

1. Using a medium sized saucepan, chop the onion and brown it in a small amount of olive oil with half a teaspoon of minced garlic.
2. Add half the mince to start, and when it is mostly cooked, add the second half. This is to prevent burning the mince due to too much in the pot.
3. Tip the entire jar of pasta sauce into the saucepan, and stir through. Simmer on low heat covered.

###Cheaters' Bechemal Sauce

Using a large heatproof jug,
1. Boil the kettle, and follow the instructions on the packets for the white/cheese sauce.
2. Be sure to use a whisk or similar to prevent lumps in the sauce as we're about to make it very lumpy!
3. When you have a good sauce, add HALF the packet of grated parmesan and stir quickly. Ideally you want the cheese to melt into the heat of the white sauce, but as long as your packet sauce has no lumps to start with, the lumpy sauce is fine.

###Construction of your Lasagne
1. Get a baking style dish to construct your lasagne in. Ideally something larger than an A4 piece of paper, but not much. So about 30 x 20/25cm and about 6-8 cms deep.
2. Grease pan with a spray on oil.
3. Spoon about one third of your meat into the bottom of the dish and cover the bottom of the dish.

  You want at least 1cm of meat on the bottom. Depending how many lasagne sheets you have, you can line the bottom with them, but generally I don't.
4. Lay your instant lasagne sheets over the meat layer, covering as much as you can.
5. Pour slowly some of your cheese sauce over the lasagne sheets. Depending how hot the sauce still is, it might run into cracks between the pasta, but that's ok.
6. Starting with the meat again, use half of it to make another layer of meat, and lay the pasta over the meat.
7. Pour half the leftover cheese over the pasta layer again.
8. Last layer, meat > pasta > Cheese.

Now to finish, you should have half the parmesan still left. Sprinkle this evenly over your last cheese layer and cover loosely with tin foil.
Bake covered, for 15 minutes, and remove the foil to cook for another 15.

Serves approx. eight.

##Tips and Tricks for Younger Players
* How many pieces you get is up to you and can depend on how WIDE the dish you use is. I have two I alternate between, one I only get 8 (large) pieces, one I get 9 squares.
* This is FABULOUS reheated. It's actually almost better reheated than the day you make it. Unsolved mystery.
* Make sure you allow enough cheese sauce at the end for the top layer or your last pasta layer will buckle and curl due to lack of water to cook it.
* You can add frozen vegies (or fresh if you're keen) to the pasta sauce to jazz it up.
* You can layer sliced eggplant instead of pasta sheets.
* My husband loves bacon in the meat.
* The meat will "pack" better in the layers if you allow it to cool, but you have to use hot cheese sauce or it won't pour.
The hot meat also provides the "water" needed to allow the pasta to cook.
